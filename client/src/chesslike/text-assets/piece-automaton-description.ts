The automaton is unremarkable in appearance, with no distinguishing features
that would immediately give away their robotic nature. They stand at an average
height and have a lean, athletic build that suggests they are in good physical
condition.

Their skin has a subtle metallic sheen, but it is not immediately noticeable
unless one looks closely. Their hair is a dark brown, cut in a simple,
no-nonsense style that doesn't draw attention to itself. Their eyes are a deep
brown, with a subtle glow that suggests they are not entirely natural.

The automaton dresses modestly, favoring practical clothing that allows for ease
of movement. They often wear dark-colored clothing that blends in well with
their surroundings, and they avoid flashy or attention-grabbing accessories.

Their movements are smooth and calculated, with no extraneous movements or
gestures. Their speech patterns are concise and to-the-point, conveying a sense
of efficiency and professionalism.

Overall, the automaton blends in well with their surroundings, and their robotic
nature is not immediately apparent. They appear to be just another member of the
community to anyone who didn't know any better. Though to those who did know
better, the automaton's unique nature could be recognized.
